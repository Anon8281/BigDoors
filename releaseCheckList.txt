- Check version number.
- Check debug statements.
- Check if release mode is selected. (e.g. DEVBUILD is set properly).
- If SQL has been updated:
    - Check if insert statement has all the variables + matching # of '?' chars.
    - Check if creating a new table is correct.
- Go over entire to-do list to see if anything still needs to be implemented.
- Update changelog.
